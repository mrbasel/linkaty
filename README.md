# Linkaty

Linkaty is an open source Android client for [Linkding](https://github.com/sissbruecker/linkding).

## Motivation

I decided to build this project mainly because I couldn't find any Android clients for Linkding but also because I wanted to practice building an app using React Native and publishing it to Google play.
